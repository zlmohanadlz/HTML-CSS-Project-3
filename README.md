## Overview

This repository contains a complete, responsive landing site composed of multiple UI sections (Articles, Gallery, Features, Testimonials, Team, Services, Skills, How It Works, Events, Pricing, Top Videos, Stats, Discount/Contact, and Footer). The layout emphasizes clean typography, spacing, and reusable components.

Use this project to:

-   practice semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques (Flexbox, Grid, variables, transitions)
-   understand how to organize static assets (images, webfonts)
-   add small interactive behaviors with vanilla JavaScript

---

## Getting Started

### 1) Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zlmohanadlz/HTML-CSS-Project-3.git
cd HTML-CSS-Project-3
```

### 2) Open locally

Just open `index.html` in your browser.

**Optional (local server):**

```bash
# using Node.js http-server
npx http-server . -p 8080
# then visit http://localhost:8080
```

No build tools are required.

---

## Usage

-   Edit content directly in **`index.html`** (section titles, texts, lists, images).
-   Replace images in **`/images`** with your own (keep filenames or update references in HTML/CSS).
-   Adjust styles in **`/Css`** (colors, spacing, typography, breakpoints).
-   Tweak interactive behavior in **`/JS/main.js`** (see below).

---

## Configuration & Customization

### Theme & Styles

Common customizations are done in the main stylesheet(s) inside `Css/`:

-   **Colors** â€“ via CSS variables (e.g., in `:root { --primary: ... }`).
-   **Typography** â€“ font families, sizes, weights, and line heights.
-   **Spacing** â€“ margins, paddings, gaps; consider using a consistent scale.
-   **Breakpoints** â€“ media queries that adapt layout for tablet/desktop.
-   **Components** â€“ cards, buttons, lists, feature blocks, pricing cards, etc.

> Tip: If you introduce new colors or spacing values, add them as variables for consistency.

### JavaScript Behavior

The project uses a minimal `JS/main.js`. Typical behaviors include:

1. **Event Countdown (Latest Events section)**

    - The script calculates remaining **days/hours/minutes/seconds** until a target date and updates the UI periodically.
    - To change the target:
        ```js
        // JS/main.js
        // Example: set a specific UTC moment (ISO format is safest)
        const targetDate = new Date("2026-12-31T23:59:59Z");
        //           or: new Date(Date.UTC(2026, 11, 31, 23, 59, 59)); // months are 0â€‘based
        ```
    - If you want to use a _local time_ instead of UTC, omit the `Z` and provide a local ISO string:
        ```js
        // Interpreted in the browser's local timezone
        const targetDate = new Date("2026-12-31T23:59:59");
        ```
    - Make sure your UI elements (e.g., `#days`, `#hours`, `#minutes`, `#seconds`) match the selectors in `main.js`.

2. **Simple UI Toggles (if present)**
    - Example patterns you might see in `main.js`:
        - Show/hide a menu or dropdown when an icon is clicked.
        - Close the menu when clicking outside (using event delegation & `stopPropagation()`).
        - Smooth scroll to sections when nav links are clicked.
    - Keep selectors (`.menu-toggle`, `.nav`, etc.) in sync with your HTML.

> If you add new interactive features, keep them modular and documented with comments in `main.js`.

---

## Accessibility Notes

-   Use **semantic elements** (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `footer`).
-   Ensure **sufficient color contrast** between text and backgrounds.
-   Provide **`alt` text** for informative images.
-   Maintain a **logical heading order** (H1 â†’ H2 â†’ H3 â€¦).
-   Make interactive controls **keyboard accessible** and visible on focus.

---

## Performance Tips

-   **Optimize images** (compress, use appropriate dimensions and formats).
-   **Preload key fonts** and define fontâ€‘display behavior (e.g., `swap`).
-   **Minify** CSS/JS for production (optional for small projects).
-   **Defer** nonâ€‘critical JS or place `<script>` tags at the end of `body`.
